      <h1> Stock Predictor </h1>

      <p> For this project, the task is to predict the Adjusted Close Price of a stock, but for learning
        purposes and efficiency we will be looking at predicting the Russell 3000 index itself. I will be
        using five values illustrating movements in the price over one unit of time. The inputs would be
        trading data for the Russell 3000 over 5 day period, 1 month and 1 year time period The key
        trading indicators are :
        ● Open: The starting price for a given trading day.
        ● Close:The final price on that day.
        ● High: The highest prices at which the stock traded on that day.
        ● Low: The lowest prices at which the stock traded on that day.
        ● Volume: The total number of shares traded before the market is closed on that day.
      </p>

      <p>From these data I will generate new features associated with the price trend by computing ratios
      between each pair of average price in three different time frames. Example, the ratio between
      the average price over the past week and over that past year. The volume is another important
      factor that investors analyze. Similarly, we can generate new volume-based features by
      computing the average volumes in several different time frames and ratios between each pair of
      averaged values.
      </p>
      <p>
      Stock volatility will be taken into consideration as well and as such we will use a standard
      deviation indicator; in this case we will use standard deviation of close prices in a particular time
      frame as well as standard deviation of volumes traded. The moving average of returns will also
      be an indicator I will employ.
